## Hi there 👋

I'm new to Github community. Still a student.

I'm currently learning CS50 Introduction to AI with Python, as I have a hackathon in April that I intend to join.

I have previous experience in ML (up to SVMs) but I would like to learn more.
Would appreciate any advice!

## Future Goals
I'm keen on following market trends and learning techniques related to said trends.
Some trends I've observed:
- API mastery
- Web scraping
- Workflow Automation
